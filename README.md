# Snippets

This repository contains snippets of a production-quality API and Single-Page Application (SPA). The code is not complete but provides examples of useful design patterns—such as dependency injection, responding appropriately to cancelled requests, and gracefully handling errors—which can be extended to further develop a complete API and SPA.

## API
The API folder contains snippets for developing a RESTful API in Go to communicate with any front-end client that accepts and sends JSON data and with a PostgreSQL database for long-term data storage.
The API folder contains an additional README.md file further discussing the code.

## SPA
The SPA folder contains snippets for developing a Single-Page Application in VueJS to communicate with any back-end server that accepts and sends JSON data.
The SPA folder contains an additional README.md file further discussing the code.
